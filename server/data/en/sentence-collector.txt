"Thank you," he answered.

"That must be a matter of opinion," said the Tin Woodman.
"That very sleeve," he said, pointing.

"Very well," answered the little man.
"Well, Bertie, dear," she said, "here we all are."
"Well, Gussie," I said.
"Well, I'm glad you're feeling braced," I said.
"Well, Jeeves," I said, "it was certainly one of those afternoons."
"Well, if you say so," said Gussie doubtfully.
"What is the matter?" said Mr. Ricardo superbly.
"With pleasure," she answered, and brought a towel at once.
"Yes," she said, nodding thoughtfully, "you're quite right."

You purchased two tons of creamed corn on March sixth.
You read the quotations in today's paper.
You really ought to do something about that haircut.
You say the race is not always to the swift.
You see I had to pile up some evidence for the inquest.
You see now how right I was.
You see the wind is so very strong here.
You see what will happen.
You see, Kitty, it must have been either me or the Red King.
You see, a minute goes by so fearfully quick.
You see, we were teaching ourselves.
You should have seen Tuppy's face when I told him.
You should have seen them when they heard me spitting Chinook.
You should listen and learn; I can teach you how to succeed
You should make the most of your hopes, wishes and desires.
You should never have agreed with her
You should stick to what you’ve started.
You stand silent and twiddle the fingers.
You surprise me, sir.
You take what?
You think it funny, do you?
You think that this would clean everything up?
You used to joyride like the very devil.
You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
You were destroying my life.
You were engaged.
You were going to leave after you saw me on the rock.
You were looking squeamish this afternoon, he began.
You were making them talk shop, Ruth charged him.
You weren't nervous?
You will need a pin in order to use a bankcard
You will need gloves; it's freezing outside.
You will need to join the end of the queue.
You will need your National Insurance Number to apply for a pension
You will sort of pave the way, as it were.
You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
You won't do it, you mean?
You won't ski well unless you bend your knees
You won’t get a soundbite from me.
You yellow giant thing of the frost.
You'll do it?
You'll find many native species of plant in this field
You'll find the dog outside, in the kennel
You'll need three teaspoonsful for that.
You'll need to measure it to work out the cost.
You're a devil for fighting, and will surely win.
You're beating a dead horse
You're going in for grab sharing.
You're going to need more practice if you're going to master that piece.
You're in love with some other bloke?
You're in room fifteen J, said the receptionist coldly.
You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
You're not the chump I took you for, Bertie.
You're positive it's what you're looking for?
You're still sticking to that?
You've heard of this business of mine, I suppose?
You, you would not keep the truth from me.
Young children often like to eat fish fingers, chips and baked beans
Young people are frequently told nowadays to reach for the stars.
Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me.
Your duty is to send your car for the police and give me up.
Your face is red with blood.
Your face was the personification of duplicity.
Your father's fifth command, he nodded.
Your genius and insight will find the way.
Your payment is due.
Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
Your privacy is very important.
Your scheme has proved a bust.
Your services are appreciated.
Your theory has been tested and proved correct.
Your tone shocks me.
Your trousers won't split.
Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
You’d be nowhere.
You’d better think about catching your train.
You’ll be catching a crab directly.
You’ll never guess! I couldn’t.
You’re a serpent; and there’s no use denying it.
You’re going to need two tablespoonsful.
Zilla relaxed her sour mouth long enough to sigh her satisfaction.
Zucchini is the same thing as courgette
and they described you jolly well, down to your boots and shirt.
‘A cat may look at a king,’ said Alice.
‘A fine day, your Majesty!’ the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
‘A quarter to two,’ he said, looking at the parlour clock.
‘Ah, what is it, now?’ the Unicorn cried eagerly.
‘Ahem!’ said the Mouse with an important air, ‘are you all ready?’
‘And how did you manage on the twelfth?’ Alice went on eagerly.
‘And washing?’ said the Mock Turtle.
‘Anything you like,’ said the Footman, and began whistling.
‘Are their heads off?’ shouted the Queen.
‘Are there many crabs here?’ said Alice.
‘Are you animal—vegetable—or mineral?’ he said, yawning at every other word.
‘Blew—me—up,’ panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath.
‘But I’m not a serpent, I tell you!’ said Alice.
‘But I’m not used to it!’ pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.
‘But about his toes?’ the Mock Turtle persisted.
‘But she must have a prize herself, you know,’ said the Mouse.
‘Call it what you like,’ said the Cat.
‘Call the next witness!’ said the King.
‘Certainly not!’ said Alice indignantly.
‘Change lobsters again!’ it yelled at the top of its voice.
‘Collar that Dormouse,’ the Queen shrieked out.
‘Come, let’s try the first figure!’ said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.
‘Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!’ thought Alice.
‘Consider your verdict,’ he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
‘Did you say pig, or fig?’ said the Cat.
‘Did you say “What a pity!”?’ the Rabbit asked.
‘Digging for apples, indeed!’ said the Rabbit angrily.
‘Does the boots and shoes!’ she repeated in a wondering tone.
‘Each with a lobster as a partner!’ it cried.
‘Exactly so,’ said Alice.
‘Faster!’ and dragged her along.
‘Feather!’ cried the Sheep, as she took up another pair of needles.
‘Fifteenth,’ said the March Hare.
‘Fivepence farthing for one—Twopence for two,’ the Sheep replied.
‘Fourteenth of March, I think it was,’ he said.
‘Give your evidence,’ said the King.
‘Good-bye, till we meet again!’ she said as cheerfully as she could.
‘Hand it over here,’ said the Dodo.
‘Have some wine,’ the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
‘He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,’ said the King.
‘Herald, read the accusation!’ said the King.
‘Hold your tongue!’ it added, before Alice could speak again.
‘How am I to get in?’ asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
‘How can I have done that?’ she thought.
‘How can she knit with so many?’ the puzzled child thought to herself.
‘How do you know I’m mad?’ said Alice.
‘How dreadfully savage!’ exclaimed Alice.
‘How should I know?’ said Alice, surprised at her own courage.
‘I am so sleepy?’ she moaned.
‘I beg your pardon?’ said Alice.
‘I call it purring, not growling,’ said Alice.
‘I don’t know what you mean,’ she said.
‘I don’t know,’ Alice said doubtfully.
‘I don’t much care where—’ said Alice.
‘I don’t see any wine,’ she remarked.
‘I like birthday presents best,’ she said at last.
‘I mean what I say,’ the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.
‘I never bet half a dozen!’ said the other.
‘I never saw one, or heard of one,’ said Alice.
‘I only wish I had such eyes,’ the King remarked in a fretful tone.
‘I see somebody now!’ she exclaimed at last.
‘I should like to hear her try and repeat something now.
‘I should win easy,’ said the Lion.
‘I talk English, don’t I?’ the Frog went on.
‘I thought it would,’ said the Cat, and vanished again.
‘I thought you did,’ said the Mouse.
‘I wish I knew!’ thought poor Alice.
‘I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud.
‘If I’d meant that, I’d have said it,’ said Humpty Dumpty.
‘It all came different!’ the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully.
‘It always happens,’ said the gnat.
‘It began with blotting paper,’ the Knight answered with a groan.
‘It can’t be anybody else!’ she said to herself.
‘It does the boots and shoes,’ it replied very solemnly.
‘It gets easier further on,’ Humpty Dumpty replied.
‘It is striking four,’ I answered.
‘It is well you are out of my reach,’ he exclaimed.
‘It isn’t mine,’ said the Hatter.
‘It isn’t respectable to beg,’ said the King.
‘It must be a very pretty dance,’ said Alice timidly.
‘It proves nothing of the sort!’ said Alice.
‘It was the best butter,’ the March Hare meekly replied.
‘It’s a fabulous monster!’ the Unicorn cried out, before Alice could reply.
‘It’s exactly like a riddle with no answer!’ she thought.
‘It’s really dreadful,’ she muttered to herself, ‘the way all the creatures argue’.
‘It’s—it’s a very fine day!’ said a timid voice at her side.
‘I’d rather see that done on paper,’ he said.
‘I’ll fetch the executioner myself,’ said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.
‘I’m a poor man, your Majesty,’ he began.
‘I’m not a mile high,’ said Alice.
‘I’m not a serpent!’ said Alice indignantly.
‘I’m not a visitor, and I’m not a servant.
‘I’m not offended,’ said Humpty Dumpty.
‘I’m not so sure of that,’ said the Unicorn.
‘I’ve got it!’ she cried in a triumphant tone.
‘Keep your temper,’ said the Caterpillar.
‘Leave off that!’ screamed the Queen.
‘Look, look!’ she cried, pointing eagerly.
‘Must a name mean something?’ Alice asked doubtfully.
‘Nearly there!’ the Queen repeated.
‘Nearly two miles high,’ added the Queen.
‘Never mind!’ said the King, with an air of great relief.
‘Never!’ said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke.
‘No, Mr. Lockwood,’ said Nelly, shaking her head.
‘No, no!’ said the Queen.
‘No,’ said the Caterpillar.
‘Nobody,’ said the messenger.
‘Nonsense!’ said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.
‘Not at all,’ gruffly remarked the elder man.
‘Not yet, not yet!’ the Rabbit hastily interrupted.
‘Not yet,’ said the Knight.
‘Nothing!’ Alice said impatiently.
‘Now, Kitty!’ she cried, clapping her hands triumphantly.
‘Of course twinkling begins with a T!’ said the King sharply.
‘Of course,’ the Dodo replied very gravely.
‘Off with her head!’ the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.
‘Oh, don’t talk about trouble!’ said the Duchess.
‘Oh, hush!’ the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone.
‘Oh, no, Sir,’ replied Mary eagerly.
‘Oh, you can’t help that,’ said the Cat: ‘we’re all mad here’.
‘Oh, you foolish Alice!’ she answered herself.
‘Oh, you sing,’ it said.
‘One, indeed!’ said the Dormouse indignantly.
‘Only a thimble,’ said Alice sadly.
‘Open the bag!’ he whispered.
‘Sap and sawdust,’ said the gnat.
‘Serpent!’ screamed the Pigeon.
‘Seven years and six months!’ Humpty Dumpty repeated thoughtfully.
‘She boxed the Queen’s ears—’ the Rabbit began.
‘She can’t do addition,’ the Red Queen interrupted.
‘She can’t explain it,’ it said hastily.
‘She’s coming!’ cried the Larkspur.
‘She’s grown a good deal!’ was her first remark.
‘She’s my prisoner, you know!’ the Red Knight said at last.
‘She’s tired, poor thing!’ said the Red Queen.
‘Sixteenth,’ added the Dormouse.
‘So much obliged!’ added Tweedledee.
‘Speak when you’re spoken to!’ The Queen sharply interrupted her.
‘Speak, can’t you?’ he cried impatiently.
‘Stand up and repeat “‘Tis the voice of the sluggard,”’ it said.
‘Suppose we change the subject,’ the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
‘Swim after them!’ it screamed.
‘Take off your hat,’ the King said to the Hatter.
‘Thank you,’ said Alice, ‘it’s very interesting’.
‘That proves his guilt,’ said the Queen.
‘That’s just what I complain of,’ said Humpty Dumpty.
‘That’s none of your business, Two!’ said Seven.
‘That’s right!’ said the Tiger-lily.
‘That’s right!’ shouted the Queen.
‘That’s very curious!’ she thought.
‘The daisies are worst of all.
‘Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!’ the soldiers shouted in reply.
‘Then if the dog went away, its temper would remain!’ the Queen exclaimed triumphantly.
‘Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,’ said the Cat.
‘Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,’ said Alice angrily.
‘Then the Dormouse shall!’ they both cried.
‘There’s nothing but hay left now,’ the Messenger said, peeping into the bag.
‘They are going to the Grange, then?’ I said.
‘They lived on treacle,’ said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.
‘Thinking again?’ the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.
‘Three hundred and sixty-five,’ said Alice.
‘Tickets, please!’ said the Guard, putting his head in at the window.
‘To answer the door?’ he said.
‘To guard against the bites of sharks,’ the Knight replied.
‘Treacle,’ said a sleepy voice behind her.
‘Treacle,’ said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
‘Turn a somersault in the sea!’ cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.
‘Very much indeed,’ said Alice.
‘Very true,’ said the Duchess: ‘flamingoes and mustard both bite’.
‘Very,’ said Alice: ‘—where’s the Duchess?’
‘Wake up, Dormouse!’ And they pinched it on both sides at once.
‘We wanted to plant some flowers there,’ she cried.
‘Well, only on Thursdays,’ said the Queen.
‘What a funny watch!’ she remarked.
‘What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!’ thought Alice.
‘What a thick black cloud that is!’ she said.
‘What are they doing?’ Alice whispered.
‘What can all that green stuff be?’ said Alice.
‘What do you call yourself?’ the Fawn said at last.
‘What else have you got in your pocket?’ he went on, turning to Alice.
‘What fun!’ it said, half to itself, half to Alice.
‘What impertinence!’ said the pudding.
‘What is it, now?’ the Frog said in a deep hoarse whisper.
‘What is the fun?’ said Alice.
‘What size do you want to be?’ it asked.
‘What sort of things do you remember best?’ Alice ventured to ask.
‘What was that?’ inquired Alice.
‘What’s that you say?’ - pretending that the kitten was speaking.
‘Where do you come from?’ said the Red Queen.
‘Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?’ he asked.
‘Which door?’ said the Frog.
‘Who are you?’ said the Caterpillar.
‘Who’s making personal remarks now?’ the Hatter asked triumphantly.
‘Why the Lion and the Unicorn, of course,’ said the King.
‘Why, because there’s nobody with me!’ cried Humpty Dumpty.
‘Why, she,’ it said.
‘Would you like to see a little of it?’ said the Mock Turtle.
‘Yes!’ shouted Alice.
‘Yes, please do!’ pleaded Alice.
‘Yes, pretty well—some poetry,’ Alice said doubtfully.
‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘we learned French and music.’
‘You did,’ said the Mock Turtle.
‘You’d better not talk!’ said Five.
‘You’re a very poor speaker,’ said the King.
‘You’re holding it upside down!’ Alice interrupted.
‘You’re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.
‘You’ve been wrong!’ cried Tweedledum.
‘You’ve missed the soup and fish,’ she said.
“A bet,” I said.
“A ripping speech,” he said.
“And that’s all I get,” he moaned.
“At your service,” he said politely.
“Bob’s got to go to town tonight,” he added, turning to me.
“But I’m a strong teetotaller,” he said pugnaciously.
“How Nellie will chuckle,” said the plump man.
“I am afraid he must put off his journey,” I said.
“I want a word with you.” And I led him into the dining-room.
“I want to write books,” he said.
“Look at the time,” said the old man.
“Mining engineer,” I said.
“Mr Scudder...” I stammered.
“Oh, damn,” said the young man.
“Pardon,” he said, “I’m a bit rattled tonight”.
“Stop that row, Paddock,” I said.
“That’s what comes of being a teetotaller,” he observed in bitter regret.
“The boy’s uncle is down there,” said Jip quietly.
“There’s two chaps below looking for you,” he whispered.
“Was it as bad as that?” he asked ruefully.
“Where did you find out this story?” I asked.
“Yes and no,” he said.
“Your paper woke them up,” he said gleefully.
“You’re the right sort of fellow,” he said.
“You’re young to be an innkeeper,” I said.
